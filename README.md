# Championing Culturally and Linguistically Diverse Voices: participatory health service research priority setting with Queensland’s multicultural communities 
Research often overlooks the views of multicultural communities. This project, led by researchers at Queensland University of Technology (QUT), aims to identify key research priorities related to health service access and equity for culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) communities in Queensland.

This project seeks to identify and prioritise health services research topics that address the needs of multicultural communities in Queensland, particularly around access to and equity in health services. Using participatory methods, including culturally appropriate community-based workshops, the project will gather insights to create a list of community-driven research questions. By engaging community members, especially those from culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) backgrounds, in setting these priorities, the project ensures future research reflects real issues these groups face. This approach fosters trust and collaboration between researchers and communities, promotes equity and supports Queensland’s Multicultural Action Plan by giving vulnerable populations a voice in research. It also builds key relationships between the research team, community-based organisations and community members for future grants.
